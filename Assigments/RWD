1. Make a program that displays several numbers.
2. Make a program that solves and shows the summation of 64 + 32.
3. Do the same as in 2, but make it sum x + y.
4. Take user input for x and y and calculate sum
5. Use a for loop to take as many as 5 numbers to add. Once user inputs 5 number calculate the sum. 

6. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers. Go to the editor
  Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
    Expected Output : 
    Number of even numbers : 5
    Number of odd numbers : 4
